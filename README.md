# YouLog: A Logging library for interactive terminals built on Golang

![screenshot](_demo/screenshot.png "terminallogging in action")

# Basic usage

    l := terminallogging.NewLog()
    l.Say("Log")
    l.Notice("Notice!")
    l.Warn("Warn!")
    l.Shout("Error!")

Each log entry gets a timestamp.


# Groups

Groups collect entries together under a single timestamp, with subsequent lines
indented:

    g = l.Group()
    g.Say("This line gets a timestamp")
    g.Say("This line will be indented with no timestamp")
    g.Done()

Groups produce no output until the .Done() method is called - a good use for
defer. terminallogging ensures that all grouped entries appear together in output.


# Streams

Streams associate log entries with a header. New stream log entries only get a
header if another log source (i.e. a different stream, group, or plain log) has
produced output in the meantime. Each stream log entry gets its own timestamp.

    g = l.Stream("This is the header")
    g.Say("The header will be printed before this line")
    g.Say("But not before this one")
    g.Done()

    g.Say("The header will be printed before this line")
    g.Say("But not before this one")
    g.Done()


# Named logs

Log entries can be named using the *As methods:

    l := terminallogging.NewLog()
    l.Say("hello")
    l.SayAs("debug", "Some debugging info")

Named entries are always silenced, unless they've been enabled specifically, like so:

    l.Enable("debug")


# Specified colors

The package is compatible with the color specifications from
github.com/fatih/color, which means that colors can be composed like this:

    l.Say("Here are some composed colors...")
    l.Say(
    	"%s %s %s",
    	color.RedString("red"),
    	color.GreenString("green"),
    	color.BlueString("blue"),
    )
